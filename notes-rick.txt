npm start      to launch the application
npm run dev    to launch the application with inspect mode (can also see the react chrome extension which gives the ability to see react variable values)

Create the following folders to hold the files that get downloaded from play.google.com
../app/components/gsutil-download-countries-files
../app/components/gsutil-download-osversion-files
../app/components/gsutil-download-overview-files

********* NOTE *******
to ensure changes get into the running build
first do
$ npm start
then
$ npm run dev
I ran into issues where just doing (npm run dev) did not have the latest changes in it.
